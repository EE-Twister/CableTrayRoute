# Load Calculation Formulas

This project evaluates electrical load using standard relationships.

- **Single-phase power**: \( P = V \times I \)
- **Three-phase power**: \( P = \sqrt{3} \times V \times I \)
- **Apparent power**: \( S = V \times I \)
- **Demand load**: \( P_{\text{demand}} = \sum P \times f_{\text{demand}} \)

Voltages are in volts, current in amperes, and power in watts. Balanced systems and steady-state conditions are assumed.
