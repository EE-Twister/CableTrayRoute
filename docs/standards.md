# Engineering References

This project relies on several established standards and publications for its electrical calculations.

- **NEC 310‑15(C)** – National Electrical Code\, 2023 edition. This section outlines how conductor ampacity must be adjusted when more than three current‑carrying conductors are installed together. The same article points to Chapter 9 for conduit fill requirements used in this tool.
- **IEEE Std 835** – *IEEE Standard Power Cable Ampacity Tables*. The thermal modeling approach implemented here reflects the guidelines and example calculations provided in this standard.
- **Neher‑McGrath Paper** – *The Calculation of the Temperature Rise and Load Capability of Cable Systems* by J. H. Neher and M. H. McGrath (AIEE Transactions, 1957). The simplified ampacity and thermal resistance equations in this app stem from this seminal work.

See this file as the citation source for comments in the code referencing each of these standards.
