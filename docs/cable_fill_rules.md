# Cable Fill Rules

Cable trays and conduits are evaluated by comparing the total cross-sectional area of installed cables against the available area.

Fill percentage is computed as:

\[ F = 100 \times \frac{\sum A_{\text{cable}}}{A_{\text{space}}} \]

Where \(A_{\text{cable}}\) is the area of each cable and \(A_{\text{space}}\) is the usable area of the tray or conduit. The tool follows NEC guidance: conduits are typically limited to 40% fill and cable trays to 50% unless noted otherwise.
