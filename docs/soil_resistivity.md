# Soil Resistivity Reference

The thermal resistance of the earth surrounding a ductbank depends heavily on soil resistivity (\u03c1). IEEE Std 835 provides typical values that are often used when detailed geotechnical data is unavailable.

Typical resistivity values:

- **60 \u00b0C\u00b7cm/W** \u2013 damp soil or clay
- **90 \u00b0C\u00b7cm/W** \u2013 average native soil
- **120 \u00b0C\u00b7cm/W** \u2013 dry sand
- **150 \u00b0C\u00b7cm/W** \u2013 dry sand and gravel

Values outside this range may be encountered in unusual conditions. The ductbank route calculator accepts custom inputs but will warn when they fall outside the typical IEEE range.
